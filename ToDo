Fixes:
. add file handling capabilities to client
. currently, users can be added to chat without being contacts
. If a chat is deleted while another user is in it, user remains in chat and can keep sending messages until they leave
. Chats can be created with the same name

Upgrades:
. keep try-catch for controllers, and event handlers, maybe even service layer. Remove the rest
. Update code to be less repetitive by using lambda and helper methods
